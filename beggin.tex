\begin{verse}
	Ridin' high, when I was king\\
	I played it hard and fast, 'cause I had everything\\
	I walked away, you want me then\\
	But easy come and easy go and it would end \\ \\
	So, any time I need ya, let me go\\
	Yeah, any time I feed you, get me? No \\
	Any time I see you, let me know\\
	But I planted that seed, just let me grow \\ \\
	I'm \textbf{on} my knees while I'm beggin'
	'Cause I don't wanna lose you
	Hey yeah, ratatata	
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
	I'm beggin', beggin' you\\
	So put your loving hand out, baby\\
	I'm beggin', beggin' you\\
	So put your loving hand out, darlin'
\end{chorus}

\begin{bridge}
	I need you to understand\\
	Tried so hard to be your man\\
	The kind of man you want in the end\\
	Only then can I begin to live again 
\end{bridge}
\begin{verse}
	An empty shell, I used to be\\
	The shadow of my life was hangin' over me\\
	A broken man, but I don't know\\
	Won't even stand the devil's dance to win my soul
\end{verse}
\begin{verse}
	What we doin'? What we chasin'?\\
	Why the bottom? Why the basement? \\
	Why we got good shit, don't embrace it? \\
	Why the feel for the need to replace me?\\ \\
	You on the \textbf{wrong} way track from the good\\
	I want to paint a \textbf{picture} tellin' where we could be at\\
	Like a \textbf{heart} in the best way should\\
	You can give it a\textbf{way}, ya had it and you took the bait\\\\
	But I keep \textbf{walk}in' on\\
	Keep \textbf{rock}in' dawns\\
	Keep \textbf{walk}ing forward\\
	Now the \textbf{court} is yours\\ \\
	Keep \textbf{brow}sin' halls\\
	'Cause I don't wanna \textbf{live} in a broken home
	Girl, I'm beggin'
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
	I'm beggin', beggin' you\\
	So put your loving hand out, baby\\
	I'm beggin', beggin' you\\
	So put your loving hand out, darlin'
\end{chorus}

\begin{bridge}	
	I'm fightin' hardTo hold my own\\
	Just can't make it all alone\\
	I'm holdin' onI can't fall back\\
	I'm just a con about to fade to black
\end{bridge}
