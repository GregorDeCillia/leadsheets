\begin{verse}
	\chord{\bassclef}{Well} I've ^{Eb}heard there was a ^{Cm}secret chord,\\
	That ^{Eb}David played and it ^{Cm}pleased the Lord\\
	But ^{Ab}you don't really ^{Bb}care for music, ^{Eb}do ya? ^{Bb} \\
	It ^{Eb}goes like this, the ^{Ab}4th, the ^{Bb}5th, \\
	The ^{Cm}minor fall and the ^{Ab}major lift, \\
	The ^{Bb}baffled king ^{G7}composing ^{Cm}hallelujah,\\

\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
    \chord{\bassclef}{Hal} le^{Ab}lujah, hallel^{Cm}ujah, hallel^{Ab}ujah,\\ 
    hallelu^{Eb} - uu^*{Ab}uuu ja^*{Eb}h
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
	Your faith was strong but you needed proof,\\
	You saw her bathing on the roof,\\
	Her beauty in the moonlight overthrew ya,\\
	She tied you to her kitchen chair,\\
	She broke your throne and she cut your hair,\\
	And from your lips she drew the hallelujah,
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
	Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah,
	hallelu-uuuuu-jah
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
	({\small \bassclef}) \textit{Baby, I've been here before,}
\\
	\textit{I know this room and I've walked this floor,}
\\
	\textit{I used to live alone before I knew ya.}
\\
	({\tiny \trebleclef}) And I've seen your flag on the marble arch, \\
	And love is not a victory march,
\\
	It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah, 
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
	Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah,
	hallelu-uuuuu-jah
\end{chorus}

\iffalse
\begin{verse}
	There was a time when you let me know,
\\
	What's really going on below,
\\
	But now you never show it to me do ya.
\\
	Well remember when I moved in you,
\\
	And the holy dove was moving too,
\\
	And every breath we drew was hallelujah,
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
	Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah,
	hallelu-uuuuu-jah
\end{chorus}
\fi
\begin{verse}
	Maybe there's a God above,\\
	But all I ever learned from love,\\
	Was how to shoot at somebody who outdrew ya.\\
	And it's not a cry that you hear at night,\\
	It's not somebody who's seen the light,\\
	It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah,
\end{verse}
