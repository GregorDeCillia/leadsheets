\end{intro}
\begin{verse}
	^{Em} In the shuffling madness^*{Em G D} \\
	^{Em} of the Locomotive Breath \\
	Runs the all-time loser \\
	^{B}Headlong to his death\\
	Oh, he ^{Em}feels the piston scraping \\
	Steam breaking on his brow\\
	Old ^{G}Charlie stole the ^{A}handle\\
	And the ^{B}train it won't stop going \\
	No way to ^{D}slow ^{Em}down
\end{verse}

\begin{verse}
	He sees his children jumping off \\
	At the stations one by one\\
	His woman and his best friend \\
	In bed and having fun\\
	Oh, he's crawling down the corridor \\
	On his hands and knees\\
	Old Charlie stole the handle \\
	And the train it won't stop going \\
	No way to slow down
\end{verse}

\begin{solo}
	Flute $\rightarrow$ Piano?
\end{solo}

\begin{verse}
	He hears the silence howling\\
	Catches angels as they fall\\
	And the all-time winner\\
	Has got him by the balls\\
	Oh, he picks up Gideons Bible \\
	Open at Page One\\
	I think God He stole the handle \\
	And the train it won't stop going\\
	No way to slow down
\end{verse}

\begin{outro}
	No way to slow down\\
	No way to slow down\\
	No way to slow down\\
	No way to slow down\\
	No way to slow down
\end{outro}
